# Problem Set 01: Logical Thinking
# CS/MATH 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2024
***

Each Problem Set (WC) contains problems on recently covered material for you to practice. These prepare you for upcoming assessments and later topics.

The first few Problem Sets, including this one, get you used to logical thinking, without necessarily relying on formal course work. This mode of thinking is required and developed in this course.

# Purpose

This is the first PSet. It familiarizes you with both the process that future Psetss will follow and the kind of thinking that will be required for them.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- some time to sit and think deeply
- a logical approach
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Grading

Grading is as per the rubric shared on Canvas.

# Task

The task for this PSet is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space in the same file.

# Deadline and discussion

The deadline is mentioned on Canvas.

For discussion on the PSet, please use the related Canvas discussion thread.
