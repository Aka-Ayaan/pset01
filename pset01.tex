  \question A father tells his two children, a boy and a girl, to play in their backyard without getting dirty. However, while playing, both children get mud on their foreheads. When the children stop playing, the father says ``At least one of you has a muddy forehead,'' and then asks the children to answer ``Yes'' or ``No'' to the question: ``Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?'' The father asks this question twice. What will the children answer each time this question is asked, assuming that a child can see whether his or her sibling has a muddy forehead, but cannot see his or her own forehead? Assume that both children are honest and that the children answer each question simultaneously.

  \question At a fashion show, Mehwish would like to determine the relative salaries of three coworkers using two facts. First, she knows that if Zara is not the highest paid of the three, then Rubya is. Second, she knows that if Rubya is not the lowest paid, then Amna is paid the most. Is it possible to determine the relative salaries of Zara, Amna, and Rubya from what Mehwish knows? If so, who is paid the most and who the least? Explain your reasoning.
