  \question In an island there are two kinds of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You encounter two people A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are if they address you in the ways described.
  \begin{parts}
    \part A says ``At least one of us is a knave'' and B says nothing.
    \begin{solution}
      A could be a knight or a knave.\\
      If A is a knight, then A's statement is True and B is the knave.\\
      If A is a knave, then A's statement is False and there is no knave.\\
      This is a contradiction as we supposed A to be a knave.\\
      Therefore, A cannot be a knave.

      So, A is a knight and B is a knave.
    \end{solution}
    \part A says ``The two of us are both knights'' and B says ``A is a knave''.
    \begin{solution}
      If A is a knight, then A's statement is True and B is also a knight.\\
      Then B's statement is True and A is a knave.\\
      This is a contradiction, as we supposed A to be a knight.\\
      Therefore, A cannot be a knight.

      If A is a knave, then A's statement is False.\\
      B's statement is now True, so B is a knight.

      So, A is a knave, and B is a knight.
    \end{solution}
    \part Both A and B say ``I am a knight.''
    \begin{solution}
      If A is a knight, then A will make the given statement.\\
      A will make the statement if A is a knave.\\
      So A may be a knight or a knave.\\
      Same for B.

      Thus, we cannot decide for A or B.
    \end{solution}
    \part A says “We are both knaves” and B says nothing.
    \begin{solution}
      If A is a knight, then A's statement is a contradiction.\\
      So A cannot be a knight.

      If A is a knave, then A's statement is False.\\
      So, it is not the case that both are knaves.\\
      So B must be a knight.

      So, A is a knave, and B is a knight.      
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}
  
  \question Three friends are hanging out at a Cafe. The server approaches them and asks, ``Does everyone want a slice of cake?'' The first friend says ``I don’t know''. The second friend says ``I don’t know''. Finally, the third friend says ``No, not everyone wants cake''. The server comes back and gives slices of cake to the friends who wanted it. 

  How did the server figure out who wanted the cake?
  \begin{solution}
    The question is if everyone wants a slice of cake. If any friend does not, then the answer is ``No''. The first friend did not answer, ``No''. So they know that they want a slice, but do not know about the others. Same for the second friend. The third friend does not want a slice, so can answer, ``No''.

    So, the first 2 friends want a slice and the third does not.
  \end{solution}
  
  \question An ancient Sicilian legend says that the barber in a remote town who can be reached only by traveling a dangerous mountain road shaves those people, and only those people, who do not shave themselves. Can there be such a barber? (\textit{Hint}: think about who shaves the barber.)
  \begin{solution}
    Imagine the barber shaves himself. Then he is not allowed to shave himself. This is a contradiction.

    Imagine the barber does not shave himself. Then he must shave himself. This is also a contradiction.

    Therefore, this barber cannot exist.
  \end{solution}
  
  \question A father tells his two children, a boy and a girl, to play in their backyard without getting dirty. However, while playing, both children get mud on their foreheads. When the children stop playing, the father says ``At least one of you has a muddy forehead,'' and then asks the children to answer ``Yes'' or ``No'' to the question: ``Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?'' The father asks this question twice. What will the children answer each time this question is asked, assuming that a child can see whether his or her sibling has a muddy forehead, but cannot see his or her own forehead? Assume that both children are honest and that the children answer each question simultaneously.
  \begin{solution}
    \underline{First ask}: ``Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?''\\
    Each sibling sees the other's muddy forehead but is unable to conclude about theirs.\\
    Each answers, ``No''.\\
    \underline{Second ask}: ``Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?''\\
    Each sibling sees that the other was unable to reach a conclusion last time.\\
    Each deduces that the reason must be that their own forehead is muddy.\\
    So, each answers, ``Yes''.
  \end{solution}
  
  \question At a fashion show, Mehwish would like to determine the relative salaries of three coworkers using two facts. First, she knows that if Zara is not the highest paid of the three, then Rubya is. Second, she knows that if Rubya is not the lowest paid, then Amna is paid the most. Is it possible to determine the relative salaries of Zara, Amna, and Rubya from what Mehwish knows? If so, who is paid the most and who the least? Explain your reasoning.
  \begin{solution}
    Let us start with the first statement. Zara could be the highest paid, or not.\\
    If Zara is not the highest paid, then Rubya is the highest paid.\\
    Then the second statement tells us that Amna is paid the most.\\
    This is a contradiction - both Amna and Rubya cannot be paid the most.

    The other possibility is that Zara is the highest paid.\\
    The second statement then leads to a contradiction if Rubya is not the lowest paid.\\
    So Rubya must be the lowest paid.

    Thus, Zara is the highest paid and Rubya is the lowest paid.
  \end{solution}
